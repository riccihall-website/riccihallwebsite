          <br />
Once...  Always .... is just how we perceive the Riccian title. This concept rooted in our heart and based in the brotherhood and loyalty we developed in Ricci Hall. Through the decades, Riccians are always keeping contact with the current residents and the linkage has never been broken.</td>

In different occasions, such as high table dinner or reunion ball, our old boys will return to share their experiences with the current Riccians. It has always been an enjoyable time for the current Riccians to learn from the "Big Sins" about their success stories. As well, it is so warm that our old boys could always share their memories as residents in Ricci Hall decades ago. The current Riccians are always delighted by their jokes and their interesting student life.</td>
