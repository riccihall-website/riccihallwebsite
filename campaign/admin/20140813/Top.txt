1	Background	Active	1		Many of you participated in the 1st Campaign for Ricci in 1990. You may recall the immediate reason for that Campaign was to raise funds to pay for the renovation of the then “new” Hall, the construction of which was largely the effort of the late Fr. Cyril Barrett, SJ. The hall opened its doors to Riccians fully in 1967. But after 23 years of heavy and constant use by its lively residents and I quote from the then Campaign Chairman Wilson Cheung’s appeal letter of 13 March 1990 : “Major renovation work on the rooms, plumbing, wiring, and interior generally, is now urgently needed”.<br><br>Another objective of the Campaign was to raise enough money not only to pay for the renovation but also to set up a permanent endowment for Ricci Hall in the form of the Ricci Hall Trust. Campaign for Ricci I, under the able leadership of Wilson and the then Deputy Warden, the late Fr. Alvaro Ribeiro, SJ, was a resounding success. Against an original target of $6 million the Campaign raised over $10 million which not only paid for the renovation which ultimately cost $8 million but also left a surplus. The surplus of some $2 million became the seed money for the Ricci Hall Trust.<br><br>Through careful management of the funds and augmented by regular though small donations, the Trust was able to help pay for some of the improvements and repairs though out the years but insufficient to pay for anything major. The Trust still has a balance of some $2 million to-day.<br><br>The reasons for the 1st Campaign – hall fees barely covered running expenses in a world of rising costs and not sufficient to pay for major repairs - apply to-day as much as it did in 1990. After the lapse of another 24 years the Hall is badly in need of another major renovation covering much of the same items as in the last exercise.<br><br>The objective of the current Campaign is to raise $30 million to finance:<ol><li>Phase 1 of the project – costing about $2 million - is to convert unused space including some common rooms; former quarters for the Cook and Room Boys into 11 rooms. There is a great demand for residential space and these rooms will bring in extra income. This is going ahead in anticipation with funds advanced by Ricci Hall Trust;<li>Phase 2 of the project – estimated to cost $25 million – is the major renovation of the hall which will include the type of work done in 1990 but more e.g. the laying of a more modern and efficient internet system;<li>Phase 3 is a study of the feasibility of constructing another block on some of the vacant land. The adding of more residential places is a priority for the University but unfortunately we will have to come up with the funds which will be enormous. This is a low priority for our Campaign.</ol><br>To move things along our Warden Fr. Robert Ng, SJ has set up a Steering Committee to co-ordinate Campaign for Ricci II:<br><br>Michael SZE (Ricci, 1967) has been invited to be the Chairman with Philip WU (Ricci, 1965) as the Hon. Treasurer and Peter LO ( Ricci, 1968) as the Hon. Legal Adviser.<br><br>Two other Committees were also formed:<br><br>Works Committee – to take charge of the planning and execution of the renovation projects: - Chaired by LEE, Chung-ming (Ricci, 1985);<br><br>Fund Raising Committee – to raise the necessary funds - Fr. Robert Ng, SJ is the Convener of this Committee with Victor WOO (Ricci, 1964) as his Deputy;<br><br>The Deputy Warden WONG, Wan-man (Ricci, 1988) is the Secretary to all the above Committees.<br><br>Obviously the most important task in front of all of us is to raise the $30 million to enable Phase 2 of the project to be launched. We are looking for suggestions as to how and who we should approach for donations. The Fund Raising Committee intends to leverage on the Hall’s 85th Anniversary, indeed the dinner at Loke Yew Hall in January marks the beginning of the Anniversary Year. The Committee has come up with the following initial proposals:<br><br>A Family Fund Day or some other mass activity to involve all Riccians and their families, not so much to raise money but to raise awareness of the Campaign and promote fellowship among Riccians of different vintages;<br><br>A Bricks Campaign similar to the one launched by HKU using the walls of the Dining Hall;<br><br>A Fund-raising Gala Dinner with auction of valuable items, sale of raffle tickets and performance by Riccians on Saturday, 17 January 2015 at the Convention and Exhibition Centre. The dinner will be the climax of the Campaign and also marks the conclusion of the Anniversary Year;<br><br>A Ricci Golf Day in Autumn of 2014 with date and venue to be confirmed;<br><br>The compilation of an up-to-date Riccian Directory and putting together a list of potential donors to facilitate direct appeal to Riccians and their friends for donations;<br><br>The naming rights of Blocks; special rooms; corridors and rooms, recognizing that most of these have been “sold” in the past; some could be sold again by adding another plaque e.g. to the doors of individual rooms; and<br><br>The organizing of concerts e.g. Cantonese Opera.<br><br>The list is not exhaustive and we welcome ideas and indeed volunteers. We are in the process of identifying and inviting “class representatives” to help us communicate directly with groups of Riccians and to implement the above and other fund raising initiatives.<br><br>This is the 1st open letter for this Campaign and we will be writing further to give you up-dates and to invite your participation in the various activities that we will be organizing in aid of the Campaign. The following are some immediate actions for you:<br><br>To help us up-date our Riccian Directory please let WONG, Wan-man at +852 90351480; or email: wongwm@graduate.hku.hk have your contact details and indeed those Riccians you are in touch with by using the attached form and providing a portrait photograph;<br><br>To give us your suggestions on how best we should conduct this Campaign especially how to raise funds;<br><br>To sign up as volunteers for the Campaign;<br><br>To mark your diary for the gala dinner on Saturday, 17 January 2015;  and<br><br>Finally and most importantly make a pledge for donation and invite your friends to do the same.<br><br>We look forward to meeting you very soon.<br><br>Yours sincerely,				0	Bottom	signatures.jpg
